# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple tic tac toe game coded in C.

### How it works
1. Each player enters the number they wish to place their sign on.
2. The program checks if there is already a sign on that specific number.
3. If there is no sign, the number is replaced by the sign, either x or o.
4. That block is updated as not empty.
5. Program continues to ask the users for input until one user wins (ie. The sign makes a vertical/ horizontal/ diagonal line).
